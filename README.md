## Teaching Materials for CS51
#### Prepared by Hakeem Angulu '20

This repository contains the teaching materials for Hakeem Angulu's code review in Harvard College's Computer Science 51: Abstraction and Design in Computation.

Over the Spring semester in 2020, it will be populated with notes, examples of code, and other pedagogical tools. By the end, it will be a completed resource for all who are interested in abstraction and design to use.
